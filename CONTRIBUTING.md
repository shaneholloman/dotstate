## Coding Standards

### Rust Style

- Follow [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
- Use `rustfmt` for formatting (run `cargo fmt`)
- Use `clippy` for linting (run `cargo clippy`)
- Prefer explicit error handling over panics
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and small
- Use modules to organize related functionality
- Document public APIs with doc comments
- Add comments for complex logic

### Error Handling

- Use `Result<T>` for operations that can fail
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Use `anyhow::Context` for error context
- Log errors appropriately (use `tracing` crate)

### Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test error cases, not just happy paths
- Use descriptive test names
- Keep tests fast and isolated

## Areas for Contribution

We're always looking for help in these areas:

- **Documentation**: Improving README, adding examples, writing guides
- **Testing**: Adding tests, improving test coverage
- **UI/UX**: Improving the TUI interface, adding features
- **Performance**: Optimizing operations, reducing memory usage
- **Platform Support**: Improving cross-platform compatibility
- **Package Managers**: Adding support for more package managers
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixing reported issues

## Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Good: "Add support for custom file paths in config"
Good: "Fix symlink creation on Windows"
Bad: "fix"
Bad: "updates"
```

Use imperative mood ("Add" not "Added", "Fix" not "Fixed").

## Review Process

1. All PRs require at least one review
2. Maintainers will review for:
   - Code quality and style
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation updates
   - Breaking changes
3. Address review comments promptly
4. Once approved, maintainers will merge
