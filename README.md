# DotState

> **A modern, secure, and user-friendly dotfile manager built with Rust**

DotState is a terminal-based tool that helps you manage your dotfiles effortlessly. Whether you're syncing your configuration across multiple machines or setting up a new development environment, DotState makes it simple, safe, and fast.

## Why DotState?

Managing dotfiles can be a pain. You want your `.zshrc`, `.vimrc`, and other config files synced across machines, but traditional solutions are either too complex, insecure, or require too much manual work.

**DotState solves this by being:**
- 🦀 **Built with Rust** - Fast, memory-safe, and reliable
- 🔒 **Secure by design** - No shell injection vulnerabilities, safe file operations
- 🎨 **Beautiful TUI** - Intuitive interface that doesn't require learning Git
- ⚡ **Lightning fast** - Non-blocking operations, instant feedback
- 🛡️ **Safe** - Automatic backups before any file operations
- 🔄 **GitHub-powered** - Your dotfiles stored securely in a private or public repo

## What Makes DotState Different?

### Traditional Dotfile Managers
- Require Git knowledge
- Manual symlink management
- No built-in backup system
- Complex setup process

### DotState
- **Zero Git knowledge required** - We handle everything
- **Automatic symlink management** - Files are linked automatically
- **Built-in backups** - Your files are safe before any operation
- **One-command setup** - Get started in seconds
- **Profile support** - Separate configs for work, personal, Mac, Linux, etc.
- **Package management** - Track and install CLI tools per profile
- **Beautiful TUI** - Visual interface with mouse support

## Features

### 🎯 Core Features

- **Mouse Support**: Click to navigate and interact
- **Real-time Feedback**: See what's happening as it happens
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- **CLI & TUI**: Full-featured CLI for automation, beautiful TUI for interactive use

### 🔒 Security

- **No Shell Injection**: Direct command execution, no shell interpretation
- **Safe File Operations**: Validates paths, prevents dangerous operations
- **Secure GitHub Integration**: Token-based authentication
- **Backup System**: Automatic backups before any destructive operation

## Installation

### From Source (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/serkanyersen/dotstate.git
cd dotstate

# Build and install
cargo install --path .
```

### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install dotstate
```

### Using Homebrew

```bash
brew install dotstate
```

*Note: Homebrew formula coming soon*

## Quick Start

1. **Launch DotState**:
   ```bash
   dotstate
   ```

2. **First-time Setup**:
   - Enter your GitHub token (create one at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens))
   - Choose repository name and location
   - Select repository visibility (private/public)

3. **Add Your Files**:
   - Navigate to "Manage Files"
   - Select files to sync (they're automatically added)
   - Files are moved to the repo and symlinked automatically

4. **Sync to GitHub**:
   - Go to "Sync with Remote"
   - Your files are committed, pulled, and pushed automatically

That's it! Your dotfiles are now synced and ready to use on any machine.

## CLI Usage

DotState also provides a powerful CLI for automation:

```bash
# List all synced files
dotstate list

# Add a file to sync
dotstate add ~/.myconfig

# Sync with remote (commit, pull, push)
dotstate sync

# Activate symlinks (useful after cloning on a new machine)
dotstate activate

# Deactivate symlinks (restore original files)
dotstate deactivate

# Show help
dotstate help
```

## How It Works

1. **Storage**: Your dotfiles are stored in a Git repository (default: `~/.config/dotstate/storage`)
2. **Symlinks**: Original files are replaced with symlinks pointing to the repo
3. **Profiles**: Different profiles can have different sets of files
4. **Sync**: Changes are committed and synced with GitHub automatically

## Security Considerations

- **No Shell Injection**: All commands use direct execution, not shell interpretation
- **Path Validation**: Dangerous paths (like home directory root) are blocked
- **Git Repository Detection**: Prevents nested Git repositories
- **Backup System**: Automatic backups before any file operation
- **Token Security**: GitHub tokens are stored securely in config files

## Requirements

- **Rust**: Latest stable version (for building from source)
- **Git**: For repository operations
- **GitHub Account**: For cloud sync (optional, but recommended)

## Project Status

DotState is actively developed and ready for use. The core features are stable, and we're continuously improving based on user feedback.
