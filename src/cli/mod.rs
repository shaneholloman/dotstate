//! CLI module for DotState command-line interface.
//!
//! This module provides a modular structure for CLI commands:
//! - `common` - Shared utilities (CliContext, prompts, output helpers)
//! - `sync` - Sync with remote repository
//! - `files` - File management (list, add, remove)
//! - `profiles` - Profile activation/deactivation
//! - `packages` - Package management
//! - `doctor` - Diagnostics
//! - `info` - Help, logs, config, repository info
//! - `upgrade` - Update checker
